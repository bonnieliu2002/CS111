CHALLENGES
-- Understanding the difference between digital and analog
-- Initially, I was going to use file redirection and write() to generate my log outputs as I did in Project 0, but upon looking on Piazza and doing some online research (please see below), I decided fopen() and fgets() are the best options to use for this project.
-- Initially, I used strcmp() for processing the commands, but I ran into issues because instead of reading in \0, my program was reading in \n. That's why strcmp() always return false. I wrote my own myStrcmp() function that only checked if 2 strings were equal.
