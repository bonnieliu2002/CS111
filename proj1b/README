DESCRIPTION
This project is a continuation of Project 1A. I built a multi-process telnet-like client and server. It can be broken up into two major steps:
1) Passing input and output over a TCP socket
2) Compressing communication between the client and server

CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED + HOW I RESOLVED THEM
-- Figuring out how the zlib library worked took quite a long time. See RESEARCH section for articles I read.
-- Initially, my sanity check was stuck at "testing trivial shell session", so I looked on Piazza and found that other students were having similar issues. The solution was to add "if (read(...) == 0)", which means end of file (no more input from socket!).
-- Deciding where to place the compressFlag statement took some time and a lot of code-tracing to figure out, especially because I didn't know if my zlib functions were working properly.
-- I was getting a weird format for my log_file, and after some debugging, I realized it was because my code printed out the entire buffer for log_file, instead of just printing out the bytes used in the buffer. The solution was to use a loop and "%.1s" in fprintf() to print 1 character from the string.
-- ^D and ^C functionalities caused me a lot of trouble, but I was able to figure it out after a lot of code tracing. It was confusing because a lot of code segments looked a little similar.
